<p class="noindent-d"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his book’s primary objective is to help you prepare for and pass Oracle’s OCP Java SE 8 Programmer II certification exam.</p>
<p class="indent">If you already have an SCJP 6 or OCP 7 certification and want to take an upgrade exam, all of the topics covered in the OCP 7 and SCJP 6 Upgrade exams are covered here as well.</p>
<p class="indent">This book follows closely both the breadth and the depth of the real exams. For instance, after reading this book, you probably won’t emerge as an NIO.2 guru, but if you study the material and do well on the Self Tests, you’ll have a basic understanding of NIO.2, and you’ll do well on the exam. After completing this book, you should feel confident that you have thoroughly reviewed all of the objectives that Oracle has established for these exams.</p>
<h3 class="h3">In This Book</h3>
<p class="noindent">This book is organized to optimize your learning of the topics covered by the OCP 8 exam. Whenever possible, we’ve organized the chapters to parallel the Oracle objectives, but sometimes we’ll mix up objectives or partially repeat them in order to present topics in an order better suited to learning the material.</p>
<h3 class="h3">In the Chapters</h3>
<p class="noindent">We’ve created a set of chapter components that call your attention to important items, reinforce important points, and provide helpful exam-taking hints. Take a look at what you’ll find in the chapters:</p>
<p class="bullt"><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   Every chapter begins with the <strong>Certification Objectives</strong>—what you need to know in order to pass the section on the exam dealing with the chapter topic. The Certification Objective headings identify the objectives within the chapter, so you’ll always know an objective when you see it!</p>
<p class="text-icon"><img src="images/onjob.jpg" alt="Images" /></p>
<p class="bull"><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   <strong>On the Job</strong> callouts discuss practical aspects of certification topics that might not occur on the exam, but that will be useful in the real world.<span id="page_xxii" epub:type="pagebreak"></span></p>

<p class="indent"><strong>Exam Watch <em>notes call attention to information about, and potential pitfalls in, the exam. Since we were on the team that created these exams, we know what you’re about to go through!</em></strong></p>

<p class="bull"><span id="page_xxx" epub:type="pagebreak"></span><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   <strong>E</strong><strong>xercises</strong> help you master skills that are likely to be an area of focus on the exam. Don’t just read through the exercises; they are hands-on practice that you should be comfortable completing. Learning by doing is an effective way to increase your competency with a product.</p>
<p class="bull"><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   The <strong>Certification Summary</strong> is a succinct review of the chapter and a restatement of salient points regarding the exam.</p>
<p class="bullt"><img src="images/tick3.jpg" alt="Images" /></p>
<p class="bull"><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   The <strong>Two-Minute Drill</strong> at the end of every chapter is a checklist of the main points of the chapter. It can be used for last-minute review.</p>
<p class="bull"><span class="gray1"><strong>Q&amp;A</strong></span></p>
<p class="bull"><img class="inline" src="images/box.jpg" alt="Images" />   The <strong>Self Test</strong> offers questions similar to those found on the certification exam, including multiple-choice and pseudo drag-and-drop questions. The answers to these questions, as well as explanations of the answers, can be found at the end of every chapter. By taking the Self Test after completing each chapter, you’ll reinforce what you’ve learned from that chapter, while becoming familiar with the structure of the exam questions.</p>
